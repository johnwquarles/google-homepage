google-homepage
===============
Practice done as part of the Odin Project curriculum-- attempting to copy the appearance of google's homepage.

Things to improve on:

Nest CSS code in a more logical fashion.

Make .png images grey when not hovered over; have the mic icon present its "search by voice" dialogue
